## What is Gradle

* Gradle is a general purpose **build system**
* It comes with a rich build description language (DSL) based on **Groovy**
* It supports **build-by-convention** principle
* But it's very **flexible** and **extensible**
* It derives from the best build tools and integrates well with **Ivy, Ant and Maven**
